Homework 2 - Responsive Website using Bootstrap


#1 About Me

The 'About Me' was used based on the bootstrap grid and using its responsive navigation bar.


The system of containers, columns, and rows (with sub rows and sub-columns) was utilized to have the right margins on the sides (for the navigation bar and the rest of the content).

The navigation bar from bootstrap becomes a sandwish menu when reduced to mobile size.
